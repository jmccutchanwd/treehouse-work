##Front End Web Development

In this track, you’ll learn how to build beautiful, interactive websites by learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — three common coding languages on which all modern websites are built. This is a useful and lucrative skill to acquire as it used by nearly every single business in the world that needs a website to communicate to its customers. By the end of this track, you’ll have all the skills required to build your own websites or even start a career with one of the thousands of companies that have a website.

This is a repository of all the code I completed while working through Treehouse's Web developer Course.
